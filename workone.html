            <h2>project overview</h2>
            <p>This 4 month project involved using the user group of seniors which are 60 years 
              and older and creating a digital app as a solution to one of their problems. Our
               team decided that we would focus on the concept of communication and connection
                which influenced our design decisions and the trajectory of the project.

            <h2>my impact</h2>
            <p>I was involved in making key decisions for the project such as what direction we 
              want to go in, specific style choices, the user experience for the group, conducting
               user interviews, creating mockups, and designing wireframes using Figma.

        <h2>ux research + problem space</h2>
        <p>Using the target group, I conducted research to identify any problems and simply look 
          at data to guide the project. After some analysis, I was presented with this statistic
           that ultimately drove our project to a social media platform.

          <h2>personas</h2>
          <p>Now that our focus was on socially isolated seniors and helping them connect, I helped
             create personas that were around our target group so that we could see from their perspective
              on what their lives were like. This helped with narrowing the scope to specific problems

            <h2>brainstorming designs</h2>
            <p>With the research conducted, our team of 3 designers each came up with an initial design that
               we thought best suited for the app. We agreed on a similar color palette and came up with the
                designs on our own. The design I created is the first one. We had chosen to go with a social
                 media app because of the need for connection but also introduce some features like messaging,
                  posting, and adding calendar events so that the senior was well integrated into their family's
                   lives.</p>

          <h2>interactive prototype</h2>
          <p>Once we decided on a final design, we began to create some sort of prototype. Here, I made some of
             the wireframes for the prototype such as the calendar page. The prototype was then put on Protopie
              where then all the frames were linked together

            <h2>usability testing</h2>
            <p>I conducted user interviews with 2 seniors that were over 60 years old and allowed them to explore
               the app. My interviews were done individually and I recorded notes as seen on the right on what
                their thoughts were, any frustrations, and any confusions. We were theoretically creating a
                 solution however without usability testing there was no way of confirming this

        <h2>putting this all together</h2>
        <p>Bringing the notes back to my team, we discussed some of the issues that were noted and began editing
           the wireframes once again. I edited wireframes and also helped create new elements like a new
            navigation bar on the bottom as the previous was too confusing with the use of the icons
        </p>

        <h2>conclusion</h2>
        <p>With the issues addressed, the final prototype was ready. Kin is a social media app with multiple
           features like calendar, adding events, messaging, and a personalized timeline. This prototype was
            created on Protopie again and shows all the different states of the app.

        <h2>reflection</h2>
        <p>This project immensely helped my personal growth into app design, ui/ux design, ux research.
           I learned the importance of design choices and how every decision matters with a proper
            understanding behind it. Working in a team taught me the importance of collaborating on a
             singular vision we had and being able to take feedback and apply it. Finally, I learned how
              to address specific user needs and have the ability to empathize with them and step into
               their perspective to get a better understanding of the problem and what I can do as the solution.
