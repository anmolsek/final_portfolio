            <h2>project overview</h2>
            <p>This 5 week project consisted of designing and creating a website using HTML and CSS.
               The goal of this project was to create a website for a business of any sort however
                it must have certain templates like product page and a checkout. I worked on this with
                 another designer as we both equally designed and coded the website from start to finish
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h2>my impact</h2>
            <p>During the length of this project, I designed the user interface of the website, and then
               coded certain parts of the website like the home page, navigation bar and footer. I also
                designed the logo of the project as well. As we were working on the same file, I also used
                 GitKraken to create a repo and store all versions of our files there
            </p>

          <h2>brainstorming</h2>
          <p>With this project, we had to narrow our scope to a certain business type. As this is a
             personal project, we chose to be playful and used our unique interest in animated characters
              to choose a plushie store. We went from other options like a gym membership business or a
               room booking site to this.

            <h2>styleguide</h2>
            <p>The colors and fonts chosen were done to reflect the bright and playful nature of the topic
               and so that users would be excited to view the site. We wanted to have an aesthetic and
                minimalist site so we went for simple interactions for elements like the button and hover
                 effects

            <h2>designing in figma</h2>
            <p>Before beginning the HTML and CSS, I used Figma to create the design of the site so that my
               teammate and I had a reference rather than blindly coding the site. I designed the logo
                beforehand and what the overall layout would look like.

            <h2>coding home page</h2>
            <p>Using a repository, both of us were pushing our files to git so that the code was up to date.
               I coded the home page entirely on my own which included the navigation bar and footer.
            </p>
          </div>

        </div>

        <h2>feedback + fixing</h2>
        <p>We had obtained feedback from our university teaching assistant that suggested that we add
           certain business elements that would communicate better with the user such as a newsletter form.
            Another helpful suggestion was styling the page better in terms of layout and making sure nothing
             looked like it was in blocks</p>

            <h2>responsiveness</h2>
            <p>As all major elements were coded and styled which includes the home page, products page,
               detailed product view, business page, and checkout, we began thinking of the responsiveness
                and how it can be optimized for different screens. Using CSS media queries, we gradually
                 adjusted our code for the Plushie Planet website to be responsive.

        <h2>conclusion</h2>
        <p>After the site was linked and responsive, the plushie selling business called Plushie Planet was
           complete. The site allows users to view the home page, different plushie products, detailed
            plushie view, using a checkout cart, finalizing payment, and reading the about us business page.

        <h2>reflection</h2>
        <p>This project taught me many fundamentals for front end web developing. I had prior experience with
           HTML and CSS however it was minimal and this project pushed me to learn new skills like
            responsiveness. I had also never used Git in any way before and through the project I learned
             the importance of working with others and saving different versions of the code. Plushie Planet
              made me more confident with my use of user interface knowledge and now front end development 
              to attempt more projects like this one.
